OpenSCAD Web Colours
====================

OpenSCAD supports setting the colour of objects using "web colour" names (documented [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/First_Steps/Changing_the_color_of_an_object)), however (as far as I know) it does not have an easy to use list of these colour names so you can't easily pick a colour from a colour by index or random number.

This library provides lists of all colours based on the extended web colours listed at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors>. Each colour range is in a separate list and there is another list will all colours.
